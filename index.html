		<h1>Dogs are the best</h1>

		<p>Dogs are the best because, unlike people (and most cats), they love you unconditionally. ... Dogs are willing to put aside their differences and live in peace, even with their natural-born enemies. Owning a dog can help kids learn about responsibility and empathy. They love to snuggle and they're the best at it.

		<p>Owning any pet is good for your heart. Cats in particular lower your stress level—possibly since they don't require as much effort as dogs—and lower the amount of anxiety in your life.
