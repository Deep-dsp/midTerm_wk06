		<h1>Dogs are the best</h1>
		<img src="huskey.jpg">
		<p>Dogs are the best because, unlike people (and most cats), they love you unconditionally. ... Dogs are willing to put aside their differences and live in peace, even with their natural-born enemies. Owning a dog can help kids learn about responsibility and empathy. They love to snuggle and they're the best at it.
